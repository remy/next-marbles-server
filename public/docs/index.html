          <section>
            <p>This web site provides a URL that devices can make HTTP GET and POST requests to. When a POST request is
              made, your "app" captures this, and when a GET is made, your app responds with your preconfigured data.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if I want to allow players to submit their high scores for my own moderation and I want to
              provide a high scores table, I my app can receive the high scores I can manually moderate those scores and
              manually update the overall high scores table.</p>
            <p>An extended feature is to use the "hooks" to dynamically update your GET response (which you can read
              about later).</p>

          <section>
            <p>Remy Sharp wrote this app because it I needed something for my own software and it didn't take much to
              enhance it into multi-user.</p>

            <p>The service is currently free, and will remain so, whilst it is able to run on a single server with
              little to
              zero maintenance.</p>
