<p>This is a free server that aims to provide some basic tools for non-developers or developers who aren't completely
  comfortable with hosting their own web platform.</p>

<p>Specifically this was built out of the need for a non-browser (a <a href="https://www.specnext.com/">Spectrum
    Next</a>) to speak to a web server over HTTP and to exchange small amounts of data.</p>

    <h2>What is this service?</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>This web site provides a URL that devices can make HTTP GET and POST requests to. When a POST request is
    made, your "app" captures this, and when a GET is made, your app responds with your preconfigured data.
  </p>
  <p>For example, if I want to allow players to submit their high scores for my own moderation and I want to
    provide a high scores table, I my app can receive the high scores I can manually moderate those scores and
    manually update the overall high scores table.</p>
  <p>An extended feature is to use the "hooks" to dynamically update your GET response (which you can read
    about later).</p>

  <p>Remy Sharp wrote this app because it I needed something for my own software and it didn't take much to
    enhance it into multi-user.</p>

  <p>The service is currently free, and will remain so, whilst it is able to run on a single server with
    little to
    zero maintenance.</p>
