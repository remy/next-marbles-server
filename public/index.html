<h1>Simple Data Service</h1>
<p>This is a free service for developers who want to accept data from machines and send simple blobs of data.
</p>
<p>For instance, you can send a high score table and you could accept high scores with some checksum data to
  manually process.</p>

<p><strong>More details coming soon.</strong></p>
